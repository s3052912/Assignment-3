              <h3> GERD Health & Fitness </h3>
              <h4> <b> Aims </b> </h4>
              <p> The overall aim of our project is to create a well-rounded mobile application that will be of assistance towards sufferers of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Meanwhile, smaller goals
                consist of Informing the app’s users about helpful information on GERD, helping them to establish exactly what types of foods/drinks they personally can and cannot consume, and to allow
                our users to observe and monitor their nutritional intake. </p>

              <p> When a person is first diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, they will be given some information and general advice from their doctor, although it is often found to require
                a lot of further research later on, particularly towards exactly what foods are and are not acidic, but also other helpful tips such as standing whilst eating, drinking a glass of water
                before each meal, and including plain rice cakes into your diet (which will soak up excess acid in the stomach). For this reason, an important part of a well-rounded mobile application
                to assist sufferers is an educational tab. <br>
                The educational tab will include many informative features, alongside a search bar, where you can input your favorite foods, and it will return information on both whether you can eat
                those foods, and what their nutritional value is. Informing users on helpful information is a back-bone goal towards our overall goal and a sure way to aid users in their recovery and
                avoidance of further symptoms/damage to their bodies. <br>
                The second most important thing for helping a person recovering from/living with GERD is for the person to be able to accurately determine what foods they can and cannot eat.
                Now, controversially to the educational tab, everyone is different, as are the number and severity of symptoms, and exactly what foods/drinks they can and cannot consume. Because of
                this, tracking symptoms will play an important role in their recovery, and therefore the diet and symptoms tracker was a crucial part of our mobile application. <br>
                The diet and symptoms tracker will do exactly this; helping the user to establish exactly what types of foods/drinks they personally can and cannot consume. This will be done using
                a diet diary, which will act as a record of what the person has consumed throughout their day/week, a symptoms tracker (which will act as a recording of the persons symptoms), and
                pop-up advice generated from the programmed analysis of the persons diet and symptoms. With thanks to the users’ data inputs and the programming then being able to take that data
                and analyze it, the application will then be able to generate personalized feedback based on these results. This feedback will be able to tell the user things such
                as “Your symptoms have been higher than average, here are the foods we suspect of causing these issues: _____” <br>
                Now, with such an ambitious application, creating it all within a shortened time from can certainly have its limits. Therefore, our team has had to approach this with the consideration
                of importance over what parts of the application are more important than others and should therefore take precedence. Whilst the three major sub-topics themselves are all very
                important parts of the overall goals for our project, there are some particulars that can be cut down where required. <br>
              As a demonstration of our function priorities, and the reasons behind these decisions, I have compiled the following list of sub-functions and their importance: <br> <br>

              <ol>
                <li> 1)	The diet diary and symptoms recordings <br>
                          a)	These have taken top priority as the most useful part of the application because even without the pop-up advice and within their rawest form, the user will be able to
                              look at these as go to guides to figure out for themselves what foods they can and can’t eat.<br>
                          b)	This has been placed above its’ close equal, the search bar in the information tab, because of its’ personalized features that not only tell what food/drinks are harmful
                              and what isn’t, but states specifics of what food is likely to be affecting that person.<br>
                </li>
                <li> 2)	The search bar in the information tab <br>
                          a)	More importantly, than helpful advice on GERD, is finding out exactly what to and not to consume to have the biggest possible impact on your symptoms. Therefore, we
                              have placed the search bar as the second highest priority.
                </li>
                <li> 3)	The information inside the information tab <br>
                          a)	The overall goal of creating this application is to assist sufferers of GERD. For this reason, informing the users takes place as one of the top priorities.
                </li>
                <li> 4)	Symptoms Tracker<br>
                          a)	Albeit less important than the top three (as they are all absolute essentials towards achieving our main goal, and directly in line with the sub-goals), the app
                              would be very plain without more to it; albeit more effort, a person could achieve the top three through a combination of Google, and pen and paper.
                          b)	The symptoms tracker is perhaps the most important step towards adding appeal to the app as it is the computerized calculations that, combined with the information
                              and necessities of the above three parts, takes out a large amount of user-effort, and an important first step towards making this app well-rounded.
                </li>
                <li> 5)	Nutrition Calculator<br>
                          a)	Similarly, to the reasons for why the symptoms tracker is important, the GERD-Based Nutritional Calculator is another large attraction for users to download our app.
                              It is a pleasantry feature, but still very helpful at the same time. The nutritional calculator is the main feature of this tab and therefore takes fifth place in
                              level of importance.
                          b)	In comparison to the other functions of the three main categories, the nutritional calculator is the one that this tab cannot do without; a meal planner function
                              relies and depends upon the nutritional calculator, and as for the fitness section of this tab, a healthy diet with good nutrition makes up 50% of the necessary
                              requirements to make progress with your personal fitness.
                </li>
                <li> 6)	Full-scale Meal Planner (for various meals throughout the day)<br>
                          a)	As a dependent of the above (the nutritional calculator), this is one that is still a useful feature and has its purpose for being included, however able to be left out
                              if time or resources were an issue.
                          b)	With that being said, being a mobile phone app, the full-scale meal planner could also be added on in a later update post-release.
                </li>
                <li> 7)	Health and Fitness component<br>
                          a)	Very much a utility, the ‘health and fitness’ component is the one part of the app that does not really relate to GERD, more so brought into the ideas with thanks to
                              the fact that GERD can affect a persons’ body weight. It is a combatant section of a singular symptom of GERD, and admittedly, even if it was included, it may not be
                              as helpful or thorough as other apps which are designed specifically for health and fitness.
                          b)	For this reason, if we did not have adequate time/resources this would be the first component that gets cut out.
                </li>

              </ol>

            </p>
              <h4> <b> Plans and Progress </b> </h4>
              <p> Our team has a common interest and motivation in our desire to help people in need. Because of this, the opportunity to create an app that could potentially do exactly this was too
                good to pass up. A member of the team, Jordan Glen, is personally affected by GERD, and has undergone quite a tough time dealing with it, including almost daily pains, regurgitation,
                nausea, and many of the other symptoms of GERD, as well as having to change his diet and liquid consumption completely, and even undergo investigative surgery in order to finally be
                diagnosed after having suffered with it for seven years before then, untreated. <br><br>
                GERD is a condition that has a wide array of symptoms, and yet (albeit sometimes requiring the assistance of medication or further surgery) changes in food and liquid consumption
                can have a drastically positive affect on the reduction of these symptoms, and the ability to allow the body to heal before further damage is done. If the person fails to do this they
                can end up with progressively worsening symptoms and the growth of ulcers on their stomach (Danisa M. Clarrett, MD 2018). <br><br>
              In addition to this, it can affect the bodyweight of a person suffering from GERD, and as such, many sufferers will go on to set fitness goals, that without very specific diet advise,
              unfortunately will be extremely difficult, sometimes impossible to achieve. The internet and world of phone applications in the present day is vast, however, to the best of our research,
              there are no applications nor websites that combine all of the Diet, Symptom and Fitness tracking features in a Mobile App
              </p>
              <p>The GERD Health & Fitness app will deliver a one-stop solution for its users to learn general information about GERD, regularly track their Diet and Symptoms, create a
                personalised Nutritional Planner, and provide a Fitness Progress Tracker.

              <!-- <h4> <b> Layout of the App </b> </h4>
              <p> <b> Desription </b> </p> -->
              <p> Building on the concepts of the GERD Health & Fitness app outlined in Assignment 2, the team agreed to carry this project idea forward and continue to further develop the app.<br> <br>
                Beginning with assigning research tasks to each team member to provide more detail about the Scope and Limits of the app, Tools and Technologies, Risks in the development lifecycle and
                Testing requirements. Where there were research areas that had elements with crossover, these tasks were paired together to ensure consistency before collaborating back with the broader
                team. Jordan and Nelson were tasked with providing more in-depth detail on the Scopes and Limitations of the app and the Tools and Technologies, as these two areas are heavily dependent
                on one another, Jordan and Nelson worked closely together to scope this out. Joe was tasked with researching the Testing and Risks areas that would need to be accounted for in the
                development of the app, again these two areas had crossover elements. Victoria was tasked with creating a prototype of the app using proto.io, the teams proto.io project can be found at:
                <a href="https://victoriasabino.proto.io/editor/index.cfm?id=b22f6036-2d44-4f70-b4f9-661d4466fc00">Proto.io - GERD - Health & Fitness</a>

              <p> Knowledge is key, particularly when it comes to medical issues, which is why we have decided that it is essential for our first tab to be a more informative one, bearing searchable
                information on what is, GERD, what symptoms to look out for, and more importantly, offering numerous pieces of advice to the user that can help reduce damage to their body and alleviate
                symptoms. </p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="column">
                    <img src="images\20.1-Screen 21.png" alt="GERD - Health & Fitness App Screen 21" style="width:50%">
                  </div>
                  <div class="column">
                    <img src="images\25.1-Screen 27.png" alt="GERD - Health & Fitness App Screen 27" style="width:50%">
                  </div>
                </div>

              <p>For added convenience, this tab will also include the option to search for numerous types of foods, which will return both nutritional information regarding this food, as well as
                whether it is a known trigger for GERD symptoms, and how acidic that item is on a scale of one to five. <br> <br>
              The diet diary would be a diary that can be filled in once a day, or to the users liking, that gathers data from the user, used to store and assess the information. The data gathered will
               be the foods and liquids consumed that day. An important part to this diary would also be the optional ability to add a diagnosis date. This date will be saved, and later considered when
               processing the information. <br> <br>
               The symptoms tracker would operate similarly to the diet diary in the way of also gathering and storing data obtained from the user, however, it would be more appropriately displayed
               in a checklist form for the purposes of gathering symptoms, meaning that data will then have consistent data feedback in the back end of the program, without having multiple variations
               of the same symptoms written, nor symptoms that have nothing to do with GERD. This will be essential to refer back to for the advice section of this process. Perhaps a symptom strength
               chart would be necessary as well. It may also be necessary to gather this information daily or weekly. The time frames being mentioned will help when planning when to send notifications
               to the user. </p>
               <img src="images\21.1-Screen 22.png" alt="GERD - Health & Fitness App Screen 22" style="width:30%">
              <p> The next function to be written (in terms of programming functions) will be the pop-up advice section. This will take the data gathered from both the diet diary and the symptoms
                tracker and assess dietary information over the last two weeks (the period necessary for all the diet related symptoms to show (Colleen M. Story 2017)). If the person has had numerous
                symptoms within that time period, it will collect the data taken from the diet diary and move it to a separate function that will add the GERD provocative foods consumed to a “possible”
                list. If foods within this list continue to match up regularly with symptoms, then it will move them from the ‘possible’ list and into the ‘likely’ list and be highlighted to the user. </p>
              <i> **It is helpful to note that the pop-up advice, in terms of its programming function, will also both receive and send data regarding the third tab; GERD-Based Nutritional Planner. ** </i>
              <p> The pop-up advice will appear on two occasions; when the user has been having issues with either symptoms, not meeting their nutritional requirements (this can be handled gently by
                subtly suggesting certain foods for the user to include in their diet and displaying the benefits of those foods) or having difficulties reaching their set out goals. The second occasion
                will be when the user is new to the app and having a look around. This will be a good opportunity to provide the user with as much useful information as possible. <br><br>
                If GERD provocative foods are eaten a number of times with no symptoms shown afterwards, then those specific foods will be moved to the ‘okay_to_eat’ list. The more foods that are gathered
                in this list, the more accurate the information can be towards discovering which foods to place in the ‘possible’ or ‘likely’ lists. For this reason, the ‘okay_to_eat’ list will need
                priority over the ‘possible’ and ‘likely’ lists. <br> <br>
                The third tab, being the ‘GERD Based Nutritional Planner’, is a section designed to assist the user in the monitoring of the nutritional side of their diet, along with the utility of
                optional assistance should they wish to embark upon a fitness/health journey as well (with thanks to the previous reference made regarding GERD also affecting a person's body weight). <br> <br>
                The nutritional planner will be generated as a few different sections within the tab, consisting of a mix of user input and tables with automated calculations to display. These sections
                will include meal nutrition calculators, a daily totals calculator, and the utility section which tracks the users progress on their personal fitness journey. To do so, upon initial
                use a pop-up will be displayed, collecting important data such as the persons age, gender, weight, height, fitness goals, previous history of fitness goals and how they went, and their
                exercise type/amount. <br> <br>
                </p>
                <div class="row">

              <p> Following on from the research completed in the Tools required section, the team needed to ensure appropriate Project Planning practices were in place to define the
                  Project Roadmap, User Requirements and Development Tasks. For this reason, Jira Software was selected as the Project Planning tool of choice. </p>
              <p> In the teams Jira account, an Epic – <a href="https://whataboutthecoders.atlassian.net/browse/WATC-1">WATC-1</a>, has been created at the top-level to plan and track the overall progress of the project.
                  Below the main Epic, we have created and linked four additional Epics for the major functional areas required in the app, these are: </p>

              <p> Screenshots of all Jira tickets are included in the <em><b> Appendix</b></em> section. </p>
              <p> For the reasons outlined in the Tools and Technologies section, the app will be developed in the Python programming language and paired with the Kivy Framework which will allow development
                  of a single app that can be used across iOS and Android devices. All development and programming of the app must be done in the PyCharm IDE and connected to the teams Github repository to
                  ensure appropriate Version Control practices are in place. </p>
              <p> After development has been completed, the app will go through three testing cycles. The first stage will be the standard unit testing performed by the developers during development, with
                no code considered ‘complete’ without having first been run many times throughout its creation, as well as at the end, where it will also be tested for any possible errors by our programming
                team. The second will be conducted during the development of the application and will be largely automated using ‘Appium’. Once satisfactory test results are seen, based on analysis from
                the Test Lead, the app will be ready to move into the third stage of testing. This will involve recruiting test users to form a focus group. The team will source these volunteers through
                GERD-related Facebook groups. The focus group will then be given the beta version of this app, and be asked to report any issues, concerns, or general feedback that they have. </p>


              <p> Finally, after the app passes through the three testing phases, it will be ready to launch to the market. The app will be published to the Android and iOS platforms, which will be completed by
                  the Lead Developer using the teams Google Play Console account to publish to the Google Play Store and using the teams Apple Developer Account to publish to the Apple App Store.
              </p>

              <h4> <b> Roles </b> </h4>
              <p> Considering the lack of experience in all aspects of mobile application development across our team, we have opted for a relatively hybrid approach to our organisational structure.
                This hybrid approach allows us to capitalise on tried-and-true software development models, while leaning towards a more flexible, ‘agile’ approach when assigning roles to individual team-members.
                This ‘agile’ approach will see all team members playing various roles across the planning, designing, developing, testing and overall management of the project, while still feeling a sense of
                ownership over their individual specialised areas. According to Planview (2022), agile business structures enable developers to “build projects around motivated individuals, gives them the
                environment and support they need, and trusts them to get the job done”. With this in mind, the following section will outline the key roles and responsibilities that have been delegated to
                all four team-members.  </p>

              <h4> <b> JORDAN GLEN: PROJECT MANAGER </b> </h4>
              <p> The project manager is "responsible for assembling the project team, assigning responsibilities, and managing schedules and resources to ensure timely completion of assigned projects”
                (University of South Florida, 2021). The project manager is commonly referred to as the ‘visionary’ of the project and is tasked with ensuring that the application remains consistent with
                the vision outlined in the original design brief for the project (Yaskevich, 2017). Finally, the project manager is responsible for ensuring that team members communicate well with each other
                and work efficiently in order to meet deadlines (exceed-team, 2021). </p>
              <p> With this in mind, the role of Project Manager has been assigned to Jordan Glen. Jordan is the original creator of our application and has a unique insight into our core demographic
                of potential customers due to his personal experience with GERD, making him the natural fit as the project’s ‘visionary’. Further, Jordan has repeatedly taken the lead when scheduling meetings
                and delegating tasks to team members. </p>

                <h4> <b> VICTORIA SABINO: USER EXPERIENCE/USER INTERFACE DESIGNER </b> </h4>
                <p> User Experience (UX) or User Interface (UI) design as it relates to mobile application development involves the design of both the visual aesthetic and the application’s workflow, with
                  an emphasis on creating a “laconic, intuitive, interesting, and engaging app design” (Pismennaya, 2021). More specifically, a UX designer is expected to deliver competitive analysis
                  reports which provide an insight into similar applications in our space, interactive prototypes, as well as in-depth user journeys which attempt to discover how a user will interact
                  with all aspects of an application. Meanwhile, UI is centred more around the visual design of an application and includes the designing of dynamic prototypes (Chawla, 2021) </p>
                <p> In larger organisations, it is common for UX and UI to be handled by separate teams. However, we have assigned all UX and UI to Victoria Sabino and will look to utilise our more ‘agile’
                  organisational structure to help spread some of her workload across the team. Victoria has been assigned this role as she has prior experience designing websites for the team and has a
                  flair for visual design. </p>

              <h4> <b> NELSON LAY: LEAD DEVELOPER </b> </h4>
              <p> Generally speaking, the lead developer is responsible for writing, testing, and debugging the core components of code behind a mobile application. Lead developers are expected to be
                proficient in a number of coding languages including Python, JavaScript, JSON, and HTML (Robert Half International, 2022). In addition to a proficiency in multiple programming languages,
                lead developers are expected to have deep understanding in database management, cybersecurity, and back-end software frameworks (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021). </p>
              <p> Nelson Lay has been given the role of Lead Developer for this project. Nelson has displayed a strong interest in developing his programming skills and is currently undertaking formal
                training in Python at RMIT. While Nelson will be spearheading the majority of the programming for our project, the volume of programming work required to meet our development goals
                means that Nelson will be required to delegate programming tasks out to the rest of the team. As with the UI/UX Design role outlined above, this further highlights the key advantage
                of our agile organisational structure. </p>

              <h4> <b> JOE SHARRATT: QUALITY ASSURANCE </b> </h4>
              <p> Quality Assurance (QA) engineers focus on “improving software development processes and preventing defects in production” (Shymkovych, 2020). More specifically, mobile QA engineers
                are responsible for ensuring that a finished product complies with the delivery standards of both the iOS and Google Play store, as well as overseeing and analysing all product testing.
                It is not uncommon for quality control to be split between a team of ‘engineers’ and ‘specialists’, where engineers are responsible for promoting good practices that will reduce the
                likelihood of errors, and specialists focus on planning and eliminating errors after the fact. Given the size of our development team, these two roles will be undertaken by one team member. </p>
              <p> Joe Sharratt has been given the role of Quality Assurance engineer and will be responsible for working closely with the lead developer and project manager to ensure that issues during
                the development process are discovered and rectified as early as possible. </p>


              <h4> <b> Scope and Limits </b> </h4>
              <p> For this assignment’s scopes and limits we have decided that our focus will be on the presentation of the app and providing further detail into two of the three planned major
                sections (Diet and Symptoms Tracker, and GERD-Based Nutritional Planner). We have left out the first section, the Information about GERD tab, because it is within the other two that
                allow us to be far more creative within our assignment with the consideration of it being an IT assignment, not a health assignment. <br>
                We seek to deliver a visual, non-fully functional app prototype which will indicate the visual side, whilst then going on to present both a skeleton OOP coding layout for the
                Diet and Symptoms tracker and a spreadsheet with in-built data and calculations to represent the Nutritional planner and its major functions.  </p>
              <p> Aside from the information about GERD tab, we have also agreed to leave out the skeleton representation of coding behind the GERD-Based Nutritional Planner, the presentation
                of the Diet and Symptoms tracker, the actual coding itself, many of the foods that could be added to the Nutritional Planner, along with two sections within those listed foods, one
                for GERD appropriate, and the other being for foods that are acidic yet one user may be able to eat them with other users not.  </p>

              <h4> <b> Tools and Technologies </b> </h4>
              <p> The following software and tools will be utilised by the team in this project,  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>•	Jira Software </li>
                <li>•	Programming Language - Python with Kivy Framework  </li>
                <li>•	PyCharm IDE </li>
                <li>•	GitHub  </li>
                <li>•	Proto.io  </li>
                <li>•	Microsoft Teams </li>
                <li>•	Appium  </li>
                <li>•	Mac computer with macOS 10.11 or 10.12 is required. </li>
                <li>•	Xcode 7 or higher </li>
                <li>•	Android SDK (with Android SDK Build Tools version 24 or higher) </li>
                <li>•	Amazon RDS </li>
                <li>•	Apple Developer Program </li>
                <li>•	Google Developer Account </li>
                <li>•	Shotcut (version 22.01.30) </li>
              </ul>
              <p> Jira Software will be used for Project Planning, the team will track the three major functional areas of the app as ‘Epics’ and specific User Requirements for each functional area
                  will be tracked in individual ‘Tasks’ and assigned out to team members to work on. Using the built-in Roadmaps feature in Jira, will provide the team with a visualisation of the
                  project timeline. Atlassian offers a free plan for using Jira Software that supports up to 10 Users and includes 2 GB of storage space. Nelson has had experience using Jira in his
                  current and past workplaces. Team Jira Page: <a href="https://whataboutthecoders.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WATC/boards/1/roadmap?selectedIssue=WATC-1">WhatAboutTheCoders Jira Page</a>  </p>
              <p> The team have selected Python as the Programming Language of choice for the app, this is due the level of Programming experience within the team. Currently, all team members have limited
                  experience in Python and no experience in any other Programming Language. Python will be coupled with the Kivy framework (Version 2.0.0), a free and open-source Python framework. Kivy allows
                  a single code block to be used across both Android and iOS mobile devices. <br> <br>
                  As Python will be used to develop the app, the PyCharm IDE (PyCharm 2021.3.1) will be used by the developers in the team for application development. The PyCharm IDE has built-in
                  Version Control integrations, this will be used to connect to the teams GitHub repository and will be critical in the development of the app as there are no co-located members in the
                  team. It also has a sleek and easy to use UI that is intuitive to the Python language and will allow faster development. Jordan and Nelson on the team have had experience using PyCharm
                  during the Introduction to Programming subject. Jetbrains offers free educational licenses for individual users of PyCharm, as the team members are all enrolled students at RMIT University,
                  there will be no cost to use the PyCharm IDE. </p>
                <p> Proto.io will be utilised to create a prototype of the application where the team can begin UX design. The prototype will give additional direction to the developers during the
                    development phase of the application and play a big part in the final presentation of the app. Proto.io have a 15-day free trial, beyond this period there are multiple plan options
                    available. If access to the Proto.io service is required after the free trial period, the two most suitable plan options for the team are the;
                  <ul>
                    <li>•	Freelancer Plan at $24 per month for 1 User  </li>
                    <li>•	Startup Plan at $40 per month for 2 Users.  </li>
                  </ul>
                    The intention is for the team to take advantage of the free trial and have the following completed within the free trial period,
                    <ul>
                    <li>•	Completed prototype of all three functional areas </li>
                    <li>•	Screenshots and specs from Proto.io project added to the relevant Jira tickets </li>
                    <li>•	Save recordings of the project in Proto.io project – to be used in the final project presentation </li>
                  </ul>
 </p>
                <p> GitHub will be required for our software repository and integrated with the PyCharm IDE to allow the team to collaboratively develop the app and maintain version control. It will
                  also store and host the team’s website. The team have had experience using Github in two Assignments delivered in the Introduction to IT course. GitHub offers a free that all team
                  members are currently signed up with. </p>
                <p> The communication tool of choice is Microsoft Teams, this is to be used by all team members to communicate via chat/IM, Video Conference calls and file sharing. </p>
                <p> Appium (version 1.22.0) will be used by the team in the first stage of testing the app, Appium will automate a large part of the testing for the team and supports testing across
                  Android and iOS platforms. Appium uses different drivers to test across both platforms, each of these drivers have their own minimum requirements. The XCUITest Driver (for iOS apps)
                  requires a Mac computer with macOS 10.11 or higher and Xcode 7 or higher are both required. The Espresso Driver (for Android apps) requires Java 8 installed and Android SDK
                  (with Android SDK Build Tools version 24 or higher). </p>
                <p> The Amazon RDS database will be used to store data from the app. Amazon RDS is a fully managed, cloud-based database service. Storing data in a database provides greater security and
                  flexibility in how users will use the app, allowing users to login from multiple mobile devices and seamlessly continue using the app. Amazon offers a Free Tier for 12 months for the
                  Amazon RDS service, this allows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>•	750 hours of Amazon RDS Single-AZ db.t2.micro Instance usage running MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle BYOL, or SQL Server (running SQL Server Express Edition) </li>
                    <li>•	20 GB of General Purpose (SSD) DB Storage </li>
                    <li>•	20 GB of storage for your automated database backups and any user-initiated DB Snapshots </li>
                    </p>
                <p> The final phase of the project will be the market release of the app, in order to publish the Android version of the app to the Google Play Store, a Google Play Console
                  account is required. This has a one-time fee for $25 to sign-up <a href="https://play.google.com/console/signup">https://play.google.com/console/signup </a> <br> <br>
                  Whilst for publishing the iOS version to the Apply App Store, an Apple Developer Program account is required. This has an annual subscription fee of $99 per year. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/  </a>
                </p>
                <p> As we prepare to launch the app to the market, the team will create a video presentation of the app. Due to location restraints, the team will record the presentation in
                    an interview style using Microsoft Teams. The video will then be further edited using Shotcut (version 22.01.30). </p>

              <h4> <b> Testing </b> </h4>
              <p> The success or failure of a mobile application can often come down to how robust the application is during its initial launch cycle. Applications that are technically sound and are
                  well maintained with timely updates are likely to remain above their competitors on both Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Likewise, applications that perform poorly, are prone to
                  crashes or other technical glitches, or fail to innovate through updates are more likely to be suppressed in search results (BitBar, 2022). Further, a poorly designed application can
                  lead to the short-term failure of an application, and potentially long-term reputational damage to a developer. Thankfully, the thorough testing of an application prior to launch
                  can help to mitigate many of the common issues that plague new application releases. The following section will outline the steps our team will be taking during the testing phase
                  of development in the hopes of ensuring our launch is as smooth as possible. <br><br>
                  There are generally considered to be two broad disciplines or streams of software testing. The first is ‘automated’ testing and consists of testing carried out by software tools.
                  Automated testing is considered to be more accurate and reliable compared with ‘manual’ testing due to its high repeatability. Further, it is often significantly faster and more
                  efficient than other forms of testing, especially in instances that require large-scale load testing, the testing of repetitive tasks, and use-cases that require the simulation
                  of hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. However, despite boasting speed and accuracy benefits, automated testing lacks the ability to conduct more subjective aspects of
                  an application such as user-experience and design aesthetics (Apica, 2017). </p>
              <p> With this in mind, the testing process for our application will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will be conducted during the course of the development of the
                  application and will be largely automated using ‘Appium’. Appium is described as an “open-source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps” (Appium, 2022).
                  Appium has been chosen as our automated testing solution as it is capable of testing applications written in Python for both iOS and Android platforms. This stage of testing will
                  commence as early as possible during the development phase as it will help detect flaws and glitches in our software before they compound and become increasingly difficult to fix. <br><br>
                  The second stage of testing will become increasingly manual and will involve the use of focus groups sourced directly through GERD-related Facebook groups and other online communities.
                  This stage will commence much closer to the initial launch of the application and will assist in ensuring that the application is user-friendly and meets the expectations of our
                  user-base. Further, manual testing will also provide much-needed insights into potential issues surrounding unexpected software crashes, hardware combability problems, memory
                  leaks, and security vulnerabilities (Smith, 2022). <br>
                  Alongside these two formal testing stages, the development team will regularly conduct a series of informal tests. These tests will be specifically designed to help provide
                  an insight into how the application impacts a mobile device’s battery life, and how the software interacts with hardware sensors including in-built gyroscopes, ambient light
                  sensors, temperature sensors, etc (Thakkar, 2020). </p>
              <h4> <b> Timeframe </b> </h4>
              <p>   </p>
              <p>   </p>
              <h4> <b> Risks </b> </h4>
              <p> The following section will discuss some of the major risks that our team could face during the development of our project and will outline the steps that will be taken
                  to mitigate issues before they occur. </p>
              <h5> <b> CODE LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES </b> </h5>
              <p> Our application is being written in Python which is an open-source, general purpose programming language and is currently the one of the most popular programming languages
                in the world according to the TIOBE Index (2022). Python’s popularity provides advantages including the fact that its large user-base means that there is a huge amount of
                open-source support available online for the language. Further, we will be using the ‘Kivy’ framework, which will allow us to easily create working versions of our application
                for both iOS and Android using one, central block of code. <br><br>
                Despite these advantages, the complexity of the Python programming language is perhaps the biggest challenge that we will face throughout the duration of the development
                process. More specifically, our team is disadvantaged in that none of our team-members have any app development experience, or any real-world experience writing in Python.
                This could lead to a number of issues including a serious lengthening of development time, a poor user experience due to excessive bugs in the program, and a worse-case
                scenario of development grinding to a complete halt if we are unable to code features into the application. <br> <br>
                Given the potentially debilitating impact that this risk could have on the development of our project, all members of the development team are taking steps to improve their
                understanding of the Python language. For example, all four members of the team are currently undertaking the ‘Introduction to Programming’ class at RMIT, which is centred
                around the Python language. This will provide our entire development team with a foundational understanding of Python and will allow us to support each other if and when
                problems occur. Likewise, we will look to take advantage of open-source support groups such as Stack Overflow, as well as programming groups on social media networks such
                as Discord and Slack. Contributing to these communities will also serve as an excellent networking opportunity, which could potentially lead to the team outsourcing future
                coding work as we continue to develop the application. </p>
              <h5> <b> FEATURE-CREEP </b> </h5>
              <p> One other potential risk that could negatively impact our development process is the phenomenon of ‘feature-creep’. Feature-creep or ‘scope-creep’ refers to the adding
                of “excessive features to a product that make it too complicated or difficult to use” (Babich 2022). In other words, feature-creep occurs when an application attempts to
                become a ‘jack-of-all-trades’ by poorly implementing too many features. Feature-creep is seen as one of the most common problems plaguing software development, and
                generally stems from “poor planning, insufficient product strategy, and misaligned priorities. Typically, requests for new features are added after the project has started,
                are out of scope, and the changes are not properly reviewed” (Babich 2022). <br><br>
                With this in mind, our team is taking steps to ensure that feature-creep does not negatively impact our project. For example, we are directing all lines of communication
                through a single application – Microsoft Teams – and ensuring that all meetings follow a strict agenda system. This ensures that any major decisions regarding changes or
                additions to features within the application are heard by the whole team prior to implementation. Likewise, any proposed changes will be reviewed against the original
                scope and objectives of our application by the entire development team. This will confirm that any proposals remain within the original scope of the project while leaving
                room for new ideas and creativity.  </p>
              <h5> <b> MISGUIDED DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIONS </b> </h5>
              <p> Issues regarding the overall direction of development often stem from a disconnect between the developer and their target audience. This leads software developers to
                implement unnecessary or unwanted features and can be another contributing factor to the risks surrounding ‘feature-creep’ described above. <br><br>
                In order to combat the potential issue of misguided development direction, our team is dedicating a great deal of time during the initial planning stages to ensuring that
                the project scope remains tightly aligned with our target audience. To assist with this, we plan on regularly asking ourselves a few key questions throughout the development
                of the project: <br>
                1.	What is the fundamental reason for developing the application? <br>
                2.	What feature/s make our application different from competing applications? <br>
                3.	Who is the application being developed for? <br> <br>
                If, at any point in time during the development of the application, our answers to the above questions stray too far from the answers given at the stages of planning, we
                will pause development and reassess our goals against the original project scope. <br>
                Further, once our application nears completion, we will reach out to our primary demographic and ask two more key questions: <br><br>
                1.	Does the application add value to the user? <br>
                2.	Is the application effective and efficient to use? <br> <br>
                Alongside these questions, the team will look to use focus groups and will take on feedback from end-users during beta testing, which will further ensure that the project
                stays closely aligned with user expectations and mitigates any potential for misguided development direction.  </p>
              <h5> <b> INSECURE DATA STORAGE (BACKUPS & VIRUS) </b> </h5>
              <p> The possibility of data loss, either through hard drive failure or through malicious computer virus could have a devastating impact on our project as it could potentially
                wipe out weeks or months of work. Thankfully, while this risk poses a very real threat to anyone developing software, there are a number of simple steps that can be taken
                to drastically minimise the negative consequences of data loss. <br><br>
                For example, our development team will be utilising a combination of cloud-based storage solutions and hard drives to store all working documents, code blocks, and digital
                designs. All code and programming-related information will be stored in a single GitHub repository, accessible to the entire team. At the same time, all individual programmers
                will be required to maintain two local copies of any code blocks that they are working on. Likewise, all development documents such as meeting notes, development plans, and
                visual design plans, will be stored both in a Dropbox account accessible to the entire team, as well as saved in two separate locations locally by the project’s Lead Developer. <br><br>
                By using a combination of cloud-based storage and hard-disk drive storage solutions, our team is adequately protected from any instances of data loss by ensuring that there
                is no single point of failure.  </p>
              <h5> <b> BLOWN-OUT DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE </b> </h5>
              <p> While our team will continuously endeavour to meet any deadlines that we set, there is always the risk of our development timeline getting blown-out due to unforeseen
                circumstances. Many of the likely causes for major delays in production are detailed above, however there is always the potential for unforeseen circumstances to negatively
                impact our project. <br><br>
                While some issues may be unavoidable, we believe that the best way that we can ensure that development remains on-track as much as possible is to closely stick to the
                communication practices outlined in the ‘Group Processes’ section of this document. Further, it is important to note any combination of the risks outlined above may occur
                at the same time, creating an exponentially negative impact on the development process. With this in mind, it is essential that our development team closely adheres to the
                mitigation steps outlined above.  </p>
              <h4> <b> Group processes and communications </b> </h4>
              <p> One of the challenges that we face is that all four members of our team are spread across Australia, meaning that face-to-face meetings would be impossible. In response
                to this, we looked into a number of different online platforms in the hopes of finding a single application that could handle the scheduling and recording of online
                meetings, facilitate a group chat for wider communications, private messaging for conversations between individual team-members, and file-sharing to allow for document
                collaboration. With this checklist in mind, we looked at a variety of options, including Slack, Facebook Messenger, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. While all of these platforms
                offered something a bit different, only Microsoft Teams met all of our requirements.  </p>
              <p> As a result, Microsoft Teams will be the exclusive medium for communication used by our team as we develop our project. Any group-wide communications including meeting
                notifications and requests for progress updates will be posted in the main Teams channel for all members to see. Team members will also use the private messaging function
                within Teams for any one-to-one communications. This is to ensure that all project-related communications – whether private or otherwise – remain within a single application
                as opposed to spreading communications across multiple platforms. Likewise, all meetings will be conducted using Microsoft Teams and will be recorded to allow team-members
                to review meetings if required. <br><br>
                The team will endeavour to meet twice per week. Once on a Monday evening to discuss action points for the upcoming week, and once towards the end of the week to provide
                a progress update. All meetings will be scheduled at a minimum of 48 hours in advance of the meeting’s start-time to ensure that team members have ample time to arrange
                to be available. As stated above, all meetings will be recorded and can be viewed by any team member who cannot make a particular meeting.<br><br>
                While we will strive to ensure regular communication at all times, there will undoubtedly be issues where people are unavailable or when they are unable to participate in group
                activities for a variety of reasons. With this in mind, we will always attempt to be as reasonable as possible when dealing with breaks in communication from individual members.
                For example, if a team member fails to turn up to a meeting without giving prior notice, they will be contacted privately with any updates from the meeting and will be asked
                if there is a more suitable time to meet so that – if possible – the group can accommodate to their schedule. More often than not, simply reaching out and offering this kind
                of assistance and support is all that is needed to resolve any communication issues. However, in serious cases where a team member is repeatedly missing meetings without
                notice and fails to respond to multiple attempts to contact them privately, they will be advised that they face expulsion from the group. After three more attempts to make
                contact over the course of two weeks, the member will be removed from the group and a replacement will be sought.  </p>
