              <h3> Nelson Lay </h3>
              <p> I’m  currently  studying  the  Bachelor  of  Information  Technology  course  through  RMIT University and currently live in Sydney, NSW. I have joined the team ‘WhatAboutTheCoders’ to deliver our Team Projectwork assignments. <br> <br> I completed High School at Macleod College in 2002 and enrolled in the Advanced Diploma of Computer Science course at RMIT in 2003. I didn’t complete the course and decided to take a study break. This study break ended up stretching outto over 15 years, where I worked across a   variety   of   roles   and   fortunately   found   my   way   int   the   IT   field,   from   frontline Helpdesk/Application Support, ERP Technical Analyst and Business Analyst roles. <br> <br> My hobbies mostly revolve around staying fit and active, getting outdoors, playing basketball on a weekly basis and play in a team in a local very amateur level competition and have recently started running on a regular basis. Sport is more often than not the genre on the TV, depending on the time of the year it will either be footy (AFL, of course) or basketball.

              <h3> Jordan Glen </h3>
              <p> I am a 25 year old male from rural South Australia, and am currently studying a Bachelor in Information and Technology, as well as a Bachelor in Programming. As part of the Information and Technology course, I have joined a team named ‘What About The Coders’, where we are working together to deliver group assignments. <br> <br>
                My  background  comes  from  humble  beginnings,  having  worked  my  way  up  from  being homeless, to working in two factory jobs, before saving up enough money to attempt to start up my own business (running a general store) whilst trading heavily in cryptocurrencies full time. I did not have enough experience to successfully run the store and soon came dependent on the money I was making trading in cryptocurrencies. I did this for sixto ninemonths before deciding that the up and down nature of passive income was not consistent enough to be doing for a full-time career. I then moved on to working as a security guard, and then into the job where  I  work  currently,  as  an  Agricultural  Bio-Security  Inspector  for  PIRSA  (a  South Australian governmental department). <br> <br>
                The dutiesof my current job, albeit enjoyable, secure, and with mostly good company, are not very challenging, nor in a fieldthat particularly grabs my attention. Having by now done my trading with cryptocurrencies for approximately 5 years and delving further into the world of making money online, I was then led into programming (running large data files/programs and automation).  This  I  found  both  interesting  and  consistently  challenging,  and  so,  being something I do already for a hobby, I have decided to try and make a hopefully lifelong career out of it. <br> <br>
                My other hobbies are in personal development, health and fitness, gaming, martial arts, and almost anything to do with adventuring/exploring.

              <h3> Joe Sharratt </h3>
              <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Security Studies at Macquarie University and am taking the  Introduction  to  Information  Technology  and  Introduction  to  Programming  courses  as electives in the hopes of eventually getting into a data science class later in my degree. <br> <br> I completed a Bachelor of Audio Engineering & Sound Production in 2011 and have worked in the entertainment industry for the past ten years. More recently, I have decided to go back to university in the hopes of transitioning into a career in intelligence. <br> <br> I am originally from the UK but grew up in Sydney. My interests include music, video games, and an unwavering love of my local football club back in England, Nottingham Forest. I also enjoy staying fit and have recently decided to try my hand at trading crypto.

              <p>I’m  currently  studying  the  Bachelor  of  Information  Technology  course  through  RMIT University   and   currently   reside   in   Gold   Coast,   QLD.   I   have   joined   the   team ‘WhatAboutTheCoders’ to deliver our Team Project work assignments. <br> <br> I  completed  my  secondary  education  through  Tweed  River  High  School  and  did  an Introduction to International Business course during my Year 11 at Griffith University to get a guaranteed entry. I completed the course and got a guaranteed entry for two degrees without the need formy ATAR score, however, I wasn’t financially stable to support my studies and
              was  forced  to  work  and  gain  experiences  from  various  roles  inbusiness  and  hospitality relatedindustry.I am now pursuing my passion with computers by studying IT and so far, it’s been great. <br> <br> My  hobbies  mostly  revolve  around  staying  healthy,  listening  to  music,playing  videogames, watching animes, and travelling. Although, I haven’t been able to travel much this past couple of years due to the pandemic,I’m hoping it changes soon.

              <h3> Group Processes </h3>
              <p>
                Assignment 2 posed several challenges to our group in the opening week or two, which left us playing catch-up for the remainder of the project. The first of these challenges was that the
                assignment started over the holiday period, and two of our original six members were away while the rest of the group started introducing themselves and early tasks were delegated.
                While this was a relatively unavoidable challenge, it meant that the opening two weeks of our group effort felt slightly disjointed and inefficient while everyone got on the same page.
                This issue was compounded when two members of our group left abruptly and without notice. These two team-members had taken on a number of small tasks, which meant that the group had to
                pick up additional tasks at short notice in order to complete the assignment. <br>
                <br>
                Despite these challenges – or perhaps because of them – our group functioned well throughout the vast majority of the project. Feedback from across the team showed that meetings were
                relatively productive, work was delegated in a fair manner, and all individuals appeared to be willing to go above and beyond to help their colleagues complete tasks. However, that is
                not to say that there isn’t significant room for improvement in the way the group operates as we work through this assignment. More specifically, our team will look to improve on the
                following areas: meeting scheduling, meeting efficiency, regular feedback, time-management.
              </p>
              <h4> Meeting Scheduling </h4>
              <p>
                One area that our team will look to improve upon for the remainder of our project regards the scheduling of meetings. During our work on Assignment 2, our team endeavoured to hold
                regular meetings at least once per week. While this generally allowed our group to efficiently delegate tasks and provide progress updates on our work, we found that it was rare
                that all-four members were present for meetings. With this in mind, our group will look schedule meetings further in advance which will allow team members more time to ensure that
                they can fit meetings into their calendars. <br> <br>
                Likewise, we will look to increase the number of meetings to at least two per week. This will allow individual team members to provide more regular updates on their progress
                with tasks and will aid with some of the improvements in time management which will be outlined below.
              </p>
              <h4> Meeting Efficiency </h4>
              <p> While it is important that we meet more regularly, it is equally important that these meetings are run as efficiently as possible. One of the major pieces of feedback from within
                the group regarding the meetings held during Assignment 2 was that meetings occasionally lacked structure. This is likely due to the fact that we worked from a single ‘live’ document
                to delegate tasks to individuals and maintain accountability over deadlines. While this document served us well at the time, it has been acknowledged that we failed to write formal
                agendas or take extensive minutes during meetings, both of which would have likely improved the efficiency of team meetings. This is something we will be looking to rectify during
                Assignment 3, not only in an effort to improve the efficiency of team meetings themselves but would also provide team members who are unable to attend meetings for any reason another
                avenue to catch up on conversations and ensure that all team members remain on the same page.
              </p>
              <h4> Regular Feedback </h4>
              <p>One additional point of improvement that the team will look to make in Assignment 3 regards team members providing each other with feedback on work as tasks are completed.
                More specifically, the team will look to review each other’s work as it is uploaded to SharePoint and provide constructive feedback where we feel work could be improved.
                This will hopefully lead to an overall improve in both the quality and the cohesiveness of our finished product. </p>
              <h5> Time-Management </h5>
              <p> While our time-management throughout Assignment 2 was generally good throughout the project, we did find ourselves making significant, last-minute changes in the hours leading up to
                the submission deadline. This meant that we did not have adequate time to thoroughly proof-read our final product and suggest improvements where necessary. Our team expects that some
                of the issues revolving around time-management will be largely dealt with by adhering to our proposed improvements in meeting scheduling and efficiency, as well as by encouraging
                team-members to provide regular feedback on work as mentioned above. Likewise, we will set deadlines for smaller tasks that will allow us to spend the final week adjusting our final
                submission, rather than writing up core content at the last minute. </p>

              <h3> Career Plans </h3>
              <p>Considering the fact that the Information Technology industry is home to a huge number of varied career paths, it is not surprising that all four members of our group have
                distinctly unique ideal jobs and career plans. For example, Nelson Lay has ambitions of becoming a Cloud Solutions Architect which would see him work with clients to design and
                implement tailor-made cloud-based solutions. In contrast, Joe Sharratt is hoping to enter into the security and intelligence sector as a Team Leader for the Australian Federal Police.
                This role would see him apply I.T. skills in a slightly more abstract way through complex database management and through the designing of bespoke software tools.
                Meanwhile, Victoria Sabino is striving to enter the world of mobile gaming as a Senior Software Engineer for Riot Games. Here she hopes to specialise in cybersecurity and develop
                anti-cheat tools. Finally, Jordan Glen is attempting to enter the finance sector as an Algorithmic Trader where he will use his I.T. knowledge to build and manipulate computer
                systems designed to give him and his clients an edge when stock-trading. <br>
                <br>
                Interestingly, despite the variation in career goals between all four members of our team, all of our career plans centre around formal, tertiary education. In fact, three out
                of four team members have stated that they will look to complete a degree in IT, with the remaining team member – Joe Sharratt – aiming to complete a degree in Security Studies.
                In addition, all four team members have acknowledged a desire to pursue further education after completing their core degree programs. These additional courses are generally
                more niche and tailored to the specific sectors that each individual is hoping to get into. Jordan Glen’s career plan serves as a great illustration of this, as he is looking
                to complete courses in financial programming and quantitative analysis once his studies at RMIT are finished. Finally, some team members such as Victoria Sabino have acknowledged
                that it is unlikely that they will be able to compete for their ideal job straight after graduating from university and have included taking on more junior or entry-level roles
                as a way to gain industry experience before working their way up.</p>
