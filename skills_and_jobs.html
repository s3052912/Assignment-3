              <h3> SKILLS & JOBS </h3>
              <p> Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease is a chronic disease that poses a major complication for the Australian healthcare system. Through the generous funding of our unnamed venture
                  capitalists, we aim to monitor one’s digestive health conditions and track multiple potential factors that could cause any form of irritation in order to avoid any possible
                  triggers and create a personalised health diary. In order to attain this with the funds provided, it is a must to hire the following professionals: <br> <br>
                  1.	Gastroenterologist – a doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating problems relating to gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver. They are important for preventive
                      care and poses as an expert to guide the whole team as they have intricate knowledge of gastrointestinal issues, such as IBS, ulcers, polyps, and chronic heartburn.<br>
                  2.	Internal medicine physicians or Internist – they are doctors who specialises in internal medicine. They also focus on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries and diseases.<br>
                  3.	Software Manager – have an experienced background regarding software development, information technology, computer science or any other related fields. They will be
                      responsible for tracking buds, planning hardware rollouts, upgrading the mobile application, and managing sprints.<br>
                  4.	Project Support Officer – should have a bit of background regarding Information Technology and assists the whole team in order to organise and keep tabs or track regarding
                      the whole project in order to provide complete assurance that the funds are being used for what they are to be used for. They should know how to communicate effectively
                      due to the roles floating nature.<br> </p>
              <p> These four professionals are all equally important for the project at hand. It is a bonus if one is suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease or has a close contact who
                  has it. The gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician are both as important as the other. Hiring them is important part of the application’s potential success as having
                  credible doctors in the team gives a great amount of assurance that we are not straying away from our main objective and will provide much-needed knowledge about gastroesophageal
                  reflux disease. The software manager locks in on overseeing and coordinating the resources and the processes required to build the new software in order to ensure a smooth
                  sailing project. Meanwhile, the Project Support Officer responds to queries from everyone involved with the project and help resolve problems that could potentially rise during
                  before and after the project. </p>
